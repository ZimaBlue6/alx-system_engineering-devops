Elizabeth it is in vain you say not
Lovethou sayest it in so sweet a way:
In vain those words from thee or L.E.L.
Zantippe's talents had enforced so well:
Ah! if that language from thy heart arise,
Breath it less forth gentlyand veil thine eyes.
Endymion, recollect, when Luna tried
To cure love hiswas cured of beside all
Hispride passion follieandfor he died.
